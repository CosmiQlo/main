Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

Why do all of these steps? The big reason is because we don't want our
production server to be cluttered up with dev dependencies like
`webpack`, but at the same time we don't want our development
git-tracking to be cluttered with production build files like
`bundle.js`! By doing these steps, we make sure our development and
production environments both stay nice and clean!
